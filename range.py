#generate a sequence of numbers using the range function

#declare range fx
# numbers = range(5)
# for number in numbers:
#     print(number)


#specified range
# numbers = range(5, 9)
# for number in numbers:
#     print(number)

#using steps
numbers = range(5, 10, 2)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
